## Section 1
Using vue-cli to generate the project automatically.

```bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init browserify my-project
```
There're several official templates for you to choose, you can change to any build tools easily if you don't like browserify. [Official Templates](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli#official-templates)

Now you are able to start your vue.js project by running `npm i && npm run dev`

For docker users:
`docker-compose up`
